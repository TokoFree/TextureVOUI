# TextureVOUI
Repo Code for all Tokopedia Texture problems!

# How to Contribute
Depends on the problem, we have 3 big areas right now:
- Texture Issues
- VoiceOver Issues
- UITest Issues

For example, you want to create an example on Texture Issue, then:
- Create a folder inside the `TextureIssue` folder
- Create the ViewController
- Add the route to that VC in the TextureIssueRouteVC.Route enum, and how to navigate to your VC.


List of issues:
- UITest ASControlNode
- UITest too nested
- VoiceOver activationPoint
- Variant ChipNode parent doesn't automatically setNeedsLayout
